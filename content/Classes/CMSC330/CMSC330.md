# Introduction
Here in CMSC330, we ask questions all about languages.
1. What is a programming language?
2. Why do so many exist, when we could (theoretically) use one to solve every problem?
3. How can we design and implement a language?

To answer these questions, we do a deep dive of various topics, using the Ocaml, Python, Racket, and Rust programming languages.

Because of the wide variety of programming languages used in this course, notes will be split up according to the type of language being used.
