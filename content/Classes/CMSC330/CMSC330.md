# Introduction
Here in CMSC330, we ask questions all about languages.
1. What is a programming language?
2. Why do so many exist, when we could (theoretically) use one to solve every problem?
3. How can we design and implement a language?

To answer these questions, we do a deep dive of various topics, using the [[Python]], [[Ocaml]], and [[Rust]] programming languages. We also discuss classifications of languages, and how to use them to build our own programming language (see [[Language Theory]]).
