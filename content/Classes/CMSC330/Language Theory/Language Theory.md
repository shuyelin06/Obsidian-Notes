Consider any possible solveable problem. No matter what the problem is, if it is solveable, then there must exist a minimum set of directions (or phrases) necessary to solve that problem. We call this minimal set a **minimum laguage** for that problem.

> [!Example]+ Example: Minimum Language for a Problem
> Say we have a problem where we need to know how we can move between two points using the cardinal directions. Then, our minimum language would be the set
> 
> $$
> \{ \text{North}, \text{East}, \text{South}, \text{West} \}
> $$

In **Language Theory**, we explore different classifications of these minimum languages, and what types of problems each classification can solve. Below, we give and describe some of these classifications.
1. [[Regular Languages]]
2. [[Context Free Languages]]
3. [[Turing Complete Languages]]

We also briefly discuss how we can use these languages to build our very own programming language, in [[Basic Language Translation]].
