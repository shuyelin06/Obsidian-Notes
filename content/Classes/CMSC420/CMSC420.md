# Introduction

To solve problems in our programs, we will often employ a wide variety of different data types. These types are not just limited to built-in types such as `int`s, `float`s, and `double`s, but also include user-defined types, whose operations we define ourselves.

Here in CMSC420, we discuss a variety of these types, henceforth referred to as **abstract data types**, which describe classes of objects whose behavior is only defined by a set of possible values and available operations. We will conceptually describe these types, and include potential implementations for such types that applications may use. 

A list of notes regarding each data structure covered is given below.
