Topics covered:
1.  [[The Real Numbers]]
2.  [[Sequences]]
3.  Continuous and uniformly continuous functions
4.  Differentiation
6.  Integration (Darboux integral): Two Fundamental Theorems
7.  Integration by parts and substitution (Sections 7.2) and Approximation of integrals: Trapezoidal, Simpson's Rules (section 7.4)
