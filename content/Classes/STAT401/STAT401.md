Suppose we have the following grade distribution.

| | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 |
| - | - | - | - |
| Jon | 70 | 80 | 90 |
| Sarah | 74 | 84 | 82 |
| Josh | 99 | 86 | 30 |

Notice how the inferences we make depend highly on the data we see! For example, if we only say Jon's scores, we see the scores are increasing, so we may guess that the exams get easier
