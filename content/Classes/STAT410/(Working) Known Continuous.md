### Uniform Distribution
The **Continuous Uniform Distribution**, denoted $X \sim u(\alpha, \beta)$, is the random variable over interval $(\alpha, \beta)$, with a uniform probability throughout.

The pdf of the Uniform Distribution is given as follows:
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
     \frac{1}{\beta - \alpha} & \alpha < x < \beta \\
     0 & \text{Otherwise}
     \end{cases}
$$

Moreover, we have a cdf which can easily be derived as
$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
                0 & x \le \alpha \\
                \frac{x-\alpha}{\beta - \alpha} & \alpha < x > \beta \\
                0 & x \ge \beta
     \end{cases}
$$
> While this looks scary, the cdf is really just a line.
