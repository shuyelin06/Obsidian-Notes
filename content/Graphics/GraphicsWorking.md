(* Standard Approximations in Graphics *)

It's a definitive fact that the real world is simply too detailed to simulate efficiency given physics and geometry. Thus, we're forced to make models approximate our world, but by their nature are restricted and have error. 

Below, we describe a variety of such approximation models, and compare / contract them.
